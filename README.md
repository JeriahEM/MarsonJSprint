I made a weather website using api and html/js
Peer review: Alex Soria: 4:30: Project does not contain much functionality. While it does have some data, it's hard to determine what it represents without asking what it is. The background is decently made, but it doesn't completely fill the page as shown in the figma. An effort was at least made to attempt to match the format, but it's clear that the lack of functionality and responsiveness makes it difficult to use.
